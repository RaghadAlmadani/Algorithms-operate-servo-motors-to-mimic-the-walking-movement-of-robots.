2. **Select Leg**: Choose a leg to move (e.g., right front).
3. **Servo Adjustments**: 
   - **Lift**: Activate servo motors to lift the leg by adjusting joint angles.
   - **Swing Forward**: Move the leg forward using servo motors to adjust joint positions.
   - **Extend**: Adjust servo motors to extend the leg to its forward position.
4. **Set Leg Down**: Lower the leg by reversing the lift servo adjustments.
5. **Shift Weight**: Adjust the balance by shifting weight using servo motors.
6. **Repeat**: Move to the next leg and repeat steps 2-5.
7. **Fine-Tune**: Continuously adjust servo motors for balance and gait optimization.
