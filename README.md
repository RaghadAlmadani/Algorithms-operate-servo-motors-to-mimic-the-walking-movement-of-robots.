Hereâ€™s a simple algorithm for a robot with legs to walk:

1. **Initialize**: Set initial leg positions.
2. **Lift Leg**: Choose a leg to lift (e.g., right front).
3. **Move Leg Forward**: Move the lifted leg forward while keeping balance.
4. **Place Leg Down**: Set the leg down at the new position.
5. **Repeat**: Switch to the next leg and repeat steps 2-4.
6. **Adjust Balance**: Continuously adjust the center of gravity for stability.
